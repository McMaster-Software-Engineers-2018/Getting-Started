# Welcome to the McMaster Software Engineers 2018 Unofficial GitHub

## Networking
With the entire class in one organization, you can easily find the GitHub profiles of others.  

## Collaborate on Software Projects
Creating a `repository` here will allow other students to join in! Every member has full administrator privileges.

_Have an interesting idea for a project but don't know where to start?_

Just create a new `repository` and pitch your idea in a new `issue` in this `repository`.

## New To GitHub?
Github is the most popular way to share and collaborate on code right now, but can seem a little strange at first.  

First try one of the many great tutorials out there and, if you're still stumped, try raising an `issue` here!

Click `Issues` at the top right of this page, then click the big green button that says `New issue`.
